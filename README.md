# Building

Open project in Xcode and run build.

# Usage

Allow [compiled binary](https://github.com/svsool/MousePortal/releases) to control your computer in Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility.

Run in your terminal:
```
chmod +x MousePortal
./MousePortal &
```

sudo might be not needed, if you will run it in iTerm2 you most probably will need to add iTerm2 to Accessibility settings as well.
